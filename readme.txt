== Description ==
The u-Ching is a new application for the Dreamspell. With this tool you are able to decode the ancient 64 hexagrams of the I Ching into their corresponding number frequency, not known before. This re-orders all the chapters of the I into U. In this ancient new knowledge we continue our study of the Genetic Code in Time. Every hexagram (or codon) is related with one of 64 UR Runes, we learned about in the Law of Time. The u-Ching became available as a gift from the People of O.M.A. around Galactic Synchronization in 2013. This Wordpress plugin works as a widget you can drop in a sidebar. It is responsive and resizes to certain proportions with theme, for example on mobile devices. 

Use the shortcode [u-ching-display] in a post or page to learn every day now about the hexagram logic, and how this new frequencies synchronize within the Galactic Seasons of the Dreamspell. The u-Ching plugin is synchronized with the "13 Moon Synchronometer" plugin and the "Cosmic History Quote" plugin. With these three plugins you are able to start your own time travelers website!

Makes a widget you can drop in a sidebar or use shortcode [u-ching-display] in post or page to synchronize the new-found number frequencies to synchronize with the Galactic Seasons of the Dreamspell.
